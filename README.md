## deephar - Deep Human Action Recognition

This software is provided as supplementary material for the CVPR'18 paper:
> 2D/3D Pose Estimation and Action Recognition using Multitask Deep Learning

# Attention! This is a WIP!

During the next few days I will be uploading code and weights corresponding
to the CVPR paper, which will be tagged appropriately. Meanwhile, I will still
make changes in that code.

<!--The software only supports data format 'channels_last'.-->

## Citing

Please cite our paper if this software (or any part of it) or weights are
useful for you.
